[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LVatN8dzHDpiXFzE_Im0yS5mbb209Ujc?usp=sharing)

## Overview
This project develops a dynamic probit modeling framework to predict excess market returns.  
It integrates classical econometric modeling with modern extensions, including dynamic autoregressive structures and machine learning.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
* Predict stock market regimes (positive vs negative excess returns) using **static** and **dynamic probit models**.
* Capture persistence and market memory effects via lagged states and lagged predicted probabilities.
* Compare probit models with a **machine learning** extension (Extra Trees classifier) for improved forecasting.

---

## ðŸ›  Methodologies Implemented
**Econometric Modeling:**
* Static Probit model with contemporary predictors.
* Dynamic Probit models with lagged market states (`Y_t`) and lagged predicted probabilities (`Ï€_t`).
* Complete autoregressive Probit combining lagged states and probabilities.

**Data Processing:**
* Stationarity testing with Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests.
* Multicollinearity analysis with VIF and correlation matrices.

**Machine Learning Extension:**
* Extra Trees classifier (PyCaret) to benchmark classical econometrics vs modern ML approaches.

**Evaluation:**
* Model selection based on AIC.
* ROC curve analysis to compare predictive performance.

## ðŸ“š Data Sources
* **Financial Data:** Yahoo Finance API (S&P500, VIX).
* **Macroeconomic Data:** FRED API (10-Year Treasury Yield, Industrial Production, Credit Spreads).
* **Period:** 2000-01-01 to 2024-01-01.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Results
* Dynamic Probit models (lagged `Y_t` and `Ï€_t`) improve predictive power compared to static probit.
* Complete autoregressive Probit model achieves the **lowest AIC** among probit models.
* Extra Trees classifier achieves a higher AUC than probit models, showing ML potential.
* Macroeconomic variables such as credit spreads and long-term rates are significant predictors.
